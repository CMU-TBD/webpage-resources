abstract = {Many academic subjects are inaccessible for students who are blind or have low vision (BLV) due to the prevalence of visual aids to represent concepts. Interactive devices offer promise as creative tools for teachers of the visually impaired (TVIs) as they can support real-time iteration of adapted learning materials, display changing information, and provide embodied learning experiences for BLV students. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 educators (all have TVI experience) and identified their considerations when creating adaptations, attitudes towards technology, and perspectives on existing barriers to access. Our findings reveal and reaffirm unresolved challenges in the adaptation process as well as offer insights into key factors that must be considered when selecting the type of adaptation. From these findings, we formulate design recommendations for interactive tools that support TVIs in creating effective adaptations for BLV students.},

abstract = {Robot navigation in crowded public spaces is a complex task that requires addressing a variety of engineering and human factors challenges. These challenges have motivated a great amount of research resulting in important developments for the fields of robotics and human-robot interaction over the past three decades. Despite the significant progress and the massive recent interest, we observe a number of significant remaining challenges that prohibit the seamless deployment of autonomous robots in crowded environments. In this survey article, we organize existing challenges into a set of categories related to broader open problems in robot planning, behavior design, and evaluation methodologies. Within these categories, we review past work and offer directions for future research. Our work builds upon and extends earlier survey efforts by (a) taking a critical perspective and diagnosing fundamental limitations of adopted practices in the field and (b) offering constructive feedback and ideas that could inspire research in the field over the coming decade.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explored how a mobile robot should join an existing multimodal interaction between a person and a stationary robot. We developed three different strategies (Circular, Line, and Improper) and an interactive system to put the strategies in practice. Circular (all interactants stand in a circle) and Line (two robots stand in a line facing a person) were based on existing human group spatial arrangements, whereas Improper (second robot stands far from the person and stationary robot) explored how a bad arrangement might change a user’s position and perception. We also investigated how scenarios with different tasks influenced human positions at different stages of the interaction. We conducted a 3x4 mixed design, in-person user study and found that participants in the Improper condition repositioned themselves to decrease the distance differences between interactants. We also conducted an exploratory analysis on the spatial data to better understand how user actions and social cues, such as gaze and vocalizations, changed spatial behaviors.},

conducted a series of experimentsand evaluated the performance of different syntactic representations. 
The promising results show that atransformer model can i) generalize an inference algorithm for

transportation due to the increase in ride-share solutions created by widespread mobile
computing and the resulting disruption of transportation worldwide. We hosted co-design
sessions with disability advocates and adapted the stakeholder tokens method from
the value-sensitive design framework to map the stakeholder ecosystem. Our key insight
is the identification of a new group of non-traditional core stakeholders who highlight
the values of inclusion, mobility, and safety within the ecosystem. Finally, we discuss
how our findings engage with concepts of disability justice and perceptions of power.},

algorithm to identify the topics around which tweet clusters occurred. Some topics
were unique to Uganda’s COVID-19 response, such as lockdown and truck drivers. Thematic
analyses within the five clusters uncovered sub-themes on conversation dynamics, and
Twitter use during the pandemic. Overall, we use Uganda as a case example of using
social media in a crisis (such as a pandemic) to provide insight into the African

create a context-independent taxonomy to differentiate and categorize the transfer

two sets of design workshops where participants generated scenarios of human-multi-robot
interactions and existing person transfers. Using the outcomes of both workshops,
we analyzed scenarios and constructed a taxonomy for person transfers with 4-dimensions:
Rationale, Type, Design, and Information Shared. We showcase different ways to utilize
the taxonomy, and, through it, we discuss the trade-offs and design considerations
in the implementation of person transfers.},

were higher when a single robot recovered from a failure on its own (by updating or
re-embodying) than when a second robot took over the task. We also found evidence
that two robots that used the same socially interactive intelligence were perceived
more similarly than two robots with different intelligences. Finally, our study revealed
a relationship between how people perceive the agency of a robot and how they perceive
the performance of the system.},

abstract = { Social agents and robots are moving into front-line positions in brick and mortar
services, taking on roles where they directly interact with customers. These agents
could potentially recognize customers to personalize service. Will customers like
this, or might they feel monitored and profiled? Robots could also re-embody (move
their “personality” between one body and another) in order to take on multiple roles
that are typically performed by different people. Will this make customers feel more
taken care of, or will it raise concerns about the robot’s competence and expertise?
Our work investigates when robots should and should not recognize customers and re-embody.
Our online study used storyboards to present possible future interactions between
robots and customers across several different service contexts. Our findings suggest
that people generally accept robots identifying customers and taking on vastly different
roles. However, in some contexts, these robot behaviors seem creepy and untrustworthy.

    abstract = {Recently, transformer language models have been applied to build both task- and non-task-oriented dialogue systems. Although transformers perform well on most of the NLP tasks, they perform poorly on context retrieval and symbolic reasoning. Our work aims to address this limitation by embedding the model in an operational loop that blends both natural language generation and symbolic injection. We evaluated our system on the multi-domain DSTC8 data set and reported joint goal accuracy of 75.8{\%} (ranked among the first half positions), intent accuracy of 97.4{\%} (which is higher than the reported literature), and a 15{\%} improvement for success rate compared to a baseline with no symbolic injection. These promising results suggest that transformer language models can not only generate proper system responses but also symbolic representations that can further be used to enhance the overall quality of the dialogue management as well as serving as scaffolding for complex conversational reasoning.},

abstract = {The connectivity aspect of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) is beneficial because it facilitates dissemination of traffic-related information to vehicles through Vehicle-to-External (V2X) communication. Onboard sensing equipment including LiDAR and camera can reasonably characterize the traffic environment in the immediate locality of the CAV. However, their performance is limited by their sensor range (SR). On the other hand, longer-range information is helpful for characterizing imminent conditions downstream. By contemporaneously coalescing the short- and long-range information, the CAV can construct comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed, safe, and effective movement planning in the short-term (local decisions including lane change) and long-term (route choice). Current literature provides useful information on CAV control approaches that use only local information sensed from the proximate traffic environment but relatively little guidance on how to fuse this information with that obtained from downstream sources and from different time stamps, and how to use the fused information to enhance CAV movements. In this paper, we describe a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach that integrates the data collected through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles located in the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use the fused data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In addition, recognizing the importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the performance of not only the algorithm but also of the vehicle in the actual driving environment, the study carried out a case study. The case study demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the appropriate CR for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected that implementation of the algorithm in CAVs can enhance the safety and mobility associated with CAV driving operations. From a general perspective, its implementation can provide guidance to connectivity equipment manufacturers and CAV operators, regarding the default CR settings for CAVs or the recommended CR setting in a given traffic environment.}
